# client recall

## Application Overview

​
client recall is a single page web application for users to organize and save important information about their client to assist in creating a smooth and positive relationship. In this case, the users are hairdressers and the important information, data, is general contact info: name, phone, email, also more specific visit info such as: visit date, cost, a personal rating, photos and notes, i.e. color formulas, haircut details, etc. I created client recall because I personally saw the need for such an app during my ten years as a hairstylist. Myself, and everyone I knew, stored notes on index cards. Those get lost and damaged easily to say the least. Not to mention, that after a year of diligent note taking, you'd have an unwieldy amount of cards. This app solves these problems. client recall takes things a step further and allows the stylist the opportunity to save a photo with each visit. Furthermore, the stylist can also rate their own performance. This feature should always encourage the user to provide the best service for their clients.

-> This app was built 100% remotely in two and a half weeks with Vanilla Javascript, React, HTML, CSS and JSON Server. I used Figma and DB Diagram to begin the imaginings and inner workings of the app. I used Zoom to participate in daily standups and to stay in contact with my learning team and any fellow student support network.
